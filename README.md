## Node Bootstrap (No.BS)

Isomorphic ES6 build & package management with auto-refresh, and support for
socket-based, isomorphic data models.

### Usage

To install, type:

```
npm install -g nodebs
```

To create a new No.BS project, type:
 
 ```
nobs my-new-project
```

This will create a new working directory with your project bootstrapped inside. To
start a development server, `cd` to your new project and enter:
 
```
yarn dev
```

When it is time to do a production build, enter:

```
yarn build
```
